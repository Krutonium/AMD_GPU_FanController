Controls your AMD GPU's fans under Linux in C#

## Goals

Control the Fans and change their speed dynamically based on the temperature.

## Things needed:

Genralize it to be able to control more than 1 GPU or GPU's in different configurations (In theory right now this only works on my GPU, because my GPU uses a weird address...)

## How to contribute:

Fork, Code, Make a PR!

## License?
